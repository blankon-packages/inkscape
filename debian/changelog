    a default install. Explain that these packages are needed in the package
    description (Closes: #294930)
  * Fix wording in the german translation of the "Could not load extensions"
    dialogue (I really should use dpatch).
  * add an additional hunk to inkscape-0.41_amd64.diff. This was sent in by
    Andreas Jochens. Again thanks to him. I hope this is really fixed now.

inkscape (0.41-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. changes to v. 0.40 include:
    + Color tracing, as well as multi-level grayscale tracing, is now possible
      with the built-in tracer.
    + Clone tiler is an exciting new way to create patterns, tesselations,
      scatterings, or just about any regular or chaotic arrangements with clones
      of an original tile.
    + Managing length units is cleaned up, extended, and centralized in the
      document units preference stored with a document. The user unit (px) of
      SVG is fully supported and made the default.
    + It is possible to invert selections via the !-key.
    + Icon theming is now possible.
    + Revised translations, new translations of some tutorials.

  * adopt the amd64 patch by Andreas Jochens to the new version
  * set build-depends libgc >= 1:6.4-1, since inkscape will not build with

    old libgc.
  * added patch to fix lintian warnings executable-not-elf-or-script.
  * suggest perlmagick to enable import files from Adobe Illustrator and
    imagemagick since the blured shadows-script needs convert.
